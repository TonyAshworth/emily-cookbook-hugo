I don't really have a recipe I use to make a good pork loin. I do, however, want to share how I cook these bad boys! I buy preseasoned pork loins when they are on sale, and toss 'em in the freezer. When I want to cook one, I thaw it in the fridge for a few days and toss it in a crock pot all by itself, and cook on low for 6-8 hours. That's it - it really is that simple. I like to serve pork loins with applesauce, veggies, and mashed potatoes.
