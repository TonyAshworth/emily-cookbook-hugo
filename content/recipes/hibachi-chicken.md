* bs chicken boobs, cut into chunks


* 2 zucchini, sliced into rounds


* 6 mushrooms, sliced


* optional onion, sliced


* 1/4 C water with 1 Tbs cornstarch mixed in

_sauce:_

* 1/4 C soy sauce


* 2 Tbs apple cider vinegar


* 1/4 tsp ginger


* 1 tsp minced garlic


* 1 Tbs sugar

Add sauce ingredients to instant pot, then add chicken and onion.

Seal and cook on high for 5 minutes. Immediately release the pressure, carefully.

Stir in cornstarch slurry, and one minute later add zucchini, and stir. I know it's a full pot, but it works!

This is amazing served with rice, or in lettuce wraps!
