Amaretto is a great gift to give your special friends over the holidays! Just don't forget to make it early! 

* 1 C water
* 1 C white sugar
* 1/2 C brown sugar
* 2 C vodka (the cheaper the better here)
* 2 Tbs almond extract
* 2 tsp vanilla extract

Combine sugars and water in a saucepan, and heat until boiling over medium heat. All sugar should dissolve. Remove from heat and let cool for 10 minutes. 

Stir vodka, almond and vanilla extracts into the mixture, and store in sealed bottles, allowing to sit in a dark cool place for at least 6 weeks to allow flavors to fully settle. This will taste sharp until it has settled.
