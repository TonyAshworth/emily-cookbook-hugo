Salads like this are so simple, and easy to personalize! You can chop veggies into small pieces or strips, vary what you prefer in it, so many possibilities! Use your fave salad dressing, which could be something as simple as a flavored vinegar and olive oil, to a strawberry blush vinagriette or french, it really is up to you!

This is my basic starting salad for our family:

* mixed salad greens - you can really use whatever lettuce you like
* cooked chicken, cut into bite sized pieces
* a few strips of cooked bacon, crumbled
* 4 or 5 hard boiled eggs, cut into strips or pieces
* 1 C cut tomatoes
* 1 C cut cucumber (english cucumbers taste so good here)
* 1 C strawberries brighten the salad, but aren't necessary
* 1 avocado, cut
