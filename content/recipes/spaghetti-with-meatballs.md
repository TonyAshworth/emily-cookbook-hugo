I don't really have a recipe, but I wanted to share how simple this can be to make - even gluten free! 

I cook this a few different ways, depending on what I'm doing that day and how early I thought of cooking. I always use premade meatballs - either mine that I made and froze, or a bag of frozen meatballs I grabbed from the store. Both are equally good. I either toss meatballs with a jar of our fave spaghetti sauce into the crock pot and cook on low for maybe 4hrs, or I bake the meatballs in the oven until well done, then add them to a pot of hot sauce. 

For noodles, since I have celiac disease, I like to use Barilla or Ronzoni gf fettuccine and the trick with them is to get the water boiling well before adding the noodles. 

Once the noodles are cooked, and the sauce and meatballs are done, serve and enjoy! This is a great time to use any bread that has gotten a bit hard (gf peeps understand this lol). Butter it up and dip it in your spaghetti!
