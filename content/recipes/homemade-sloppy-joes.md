1lb ground beef

1 tsp minced garlic

sprinkle of dried minced onion (you can use real onions, we just don't like em)

1 Tbs flour

1 C beef broth or water

2 tsp worcestershire sauce

3/4 C ketchup

Saute beef with onions and garlic, until beef is done. Drain fat, and stir in rest of ingredients. Simmer for 10 to 20 minutes, until the sauce reaches desired consistency. We love these with toasted buns!
