Milkshakes are so easy at home, and so good! You can personalize this in so many ways, by changing up the flavors you use and what kind of ice cream! We like to use high protein ice cream, or lactaid ice cream, and use peaches or strawberries. 

* 1 pint vanilla ice cream
* 10oz bag of fruit (peaches, strawberries, blueberries, etc. work well) OR try other add ins, like 6 oreo cookies (if using hard foods, blend those first then add other ingredients)
* 1/4 C milk

Let the ice cream soften just a little, and blend all until smooth, Drink immediately! *You can change the consistency by adding less or more milk.
