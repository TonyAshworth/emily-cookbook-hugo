This recipe makes an egg free, dairy free chocolate cake that is just amazing! No one will know it is allergen friendly!

* 1 1/2 C flour
* 3 Tbs cocoa powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 5 Tbs vegetable oil
* 1 C sugar
* 1 Tbs vinegar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 C water

Mix flour, cocoa, soda, and sugar in a large bowl. Add oil, vanilla, water and vinegar, and slowly stir until well combined. Once completely mixed pour into an 8x8 or 9x9 baking pan.

Bake for between a half an hour to 45 minutes, depending on your oven's mood and the time of year, moisture content in the air, who the heck knows I just know my bake time always varies a tad! Do the toothpick test in the middle of the cake to ensure you don't have any uncooked batter left.
