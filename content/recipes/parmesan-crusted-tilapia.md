* one fillet per person
* parmesan cheese, maybe half a cup at a time
* 1 tsp paprika
* olive oil

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a baking sheet.

Whisk together parmesan and paprika in a low bowl. Coat each fillet with olive oil, and press each side into the cheese mixture, then place onto baking sheet. 

Bake in oven until fish flakes easily with fork, usually 20-25 minutes for me.
