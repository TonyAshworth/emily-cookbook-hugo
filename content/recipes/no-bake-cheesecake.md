* 2 - 8 oz packages cream cheese, softened
* 1/3 C sugar
* 1 ginger snap pie crust
* 2 Tbs lemon juice
* 1 small tub cool whip
* strawberries and blueberries if desired for topping

Beat cheese, sugar, and lemon juice until well blended. Stir in 2 C cool whip. Spoon into prepared crust, and refrigerate for at least three hours. Spread remaining cool whip on top and top with fruit!

\*this is super easy, and is great to make the day before to bring to a party! Also excellent to bring to a July 4th party if you make a flag with the berries - get creative!
