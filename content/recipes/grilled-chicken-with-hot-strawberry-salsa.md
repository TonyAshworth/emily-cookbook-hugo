* 1 lime
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 2 tsp olive oil
* bs chicken breasts, we use 6 breasts filleted for this
* 2 C strawberries, cut into pieces
* 1 C pineapple, cut into pieces
* 1/4 C red onion, minced (optional)
* 2 Tbs fresh cilantro or basil
* jalapeno pepper seeded and minced, to taste (start with maybe 2 tsp)
* 1 tsp sugar

Zest and juice lime, and set each aside. Preheat grill. 

Combine 1 Tbs lime juice, garlic, and 1/2 tsp oil, and coat chicken. 

While grill is heating, make salsa: combine strawberries, pineapple, onion, cilantro OR basil, jalapeno, sugar, remaining lime juice and zest, 1 1/2 tsp oil. Stir well and set aside. 

Grill chicken to at least 165 degrees (I prefer 180), and serve with salsa.
