Pour 1 cup of cold water into your instant pot, and add your instant pot rack/trivet.

Prick holes in potatoes, and place onto trivet (I usually cook 4-6 large potatoes, single layer).

Cook 12 minutes on high, sealed, and naturally release for 10 minutes and then release the seal. Potatoes should be soft and creamy, so good!
