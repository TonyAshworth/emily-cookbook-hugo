* at least 3, 1" or so thick, pork chops, we have done up to 12 at once
* 1 tsp paprika
* 2 Tbs brown sugar
* 1/2 Tbs worcestershire sauce
* 1 Tbs butter
* 1 C chicken broth

Mix paprika and sugar and coat chops.

With your instant pot on saute mode, melt butter and then sear pork chops on both sides (mine fits 5 at a time if I am lucky). Remove chops and turn off.

Add broth and deglaze (remove any stuck bits from the bottom of the pot). Add worcestershire sauce and chops.

Seal pot, and cook on high for 7 minutes. Allow to release naturally for 12 minutes, then release pressure. Enjoy!
