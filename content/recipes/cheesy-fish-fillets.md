* 1 fillet per person of your fave white fish
* 2 Tbs butter
* 2 Tbs flour
* 2 C milk
* 4 oz shredded cheddar cheese

Preheat oven to 350. Spray appropriately sized baking dish with cooking spray, or spread a thin layer of oil, and place fish fillets in baking dish (we usually cook 5 fillets and stuff em into a 9x13)

In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and stir, then add milk. Do not walk away from this! The milk will heat up, and suddenly reach a point where the mixture will start to thicken quickly. When that happens, remove the pan from heat and stir in the cheese. Stir until melted.

Pour sauce over fish, and bake in oven 20 to 40 minutes, depending on what type of fish you use. The thicker the fillets, the longer they need to cook. Fish is done when it flakes apart easily.
