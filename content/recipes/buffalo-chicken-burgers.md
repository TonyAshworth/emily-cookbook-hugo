_burgers:_ 

1\.5 to 2lbs ground chicken

1 tsp poultry seasoning

1 tsp paprika

9 Tbs of hot sauce (we use Frank's)

9 Tbs butter, melted

_sauce:_ 

1/4 C sour cream

1/4 tsp worcestershire sauce

2 Tbs mayo

1 tsp garlic powder

buns and burger toppings if desired

In a large bowl, mix together the chicken, poultry seasoning, paprika, one Tbs of melted butter, and 1 Tbs hot sauce (you can adjust this if you want). Form into burgers and cook in a skillet or on grill, until cooked throughout. 

Mix together the remaining melted butter and hot sauce, and pour over burgers. 

Mix sauce ingredients in small bowl, and serve with burgers!
