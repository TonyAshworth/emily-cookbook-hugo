bs chicken boobs, cut into either chunks

2 Tbs jerk seasoning

3 Tbs vegetable oil

2 Tbs soy sauce

1 Tbs apple cider vinegar

1 C chicken broth

Mix all but broth together in instant pot, and turn on saute. Sear chicken, maybe 2 minutes per side, and turn off. Pour in broth, scrape any stuck on bits off the bottom.

Seal and cook on high for 10 minutes, and immediately release pressure. You can shred this and serve on buns, or serve as is with sides!
