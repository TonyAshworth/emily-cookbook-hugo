2 Tbs butter

dried minced onion, maybe a tbs?

12oz frozen mixed veggies

1 1/2 C or so of cooked chicken, shredded

1 3/4 C chicken broth

3/4 C milk with 3 Tbs cornstarch mixed in

_topping:_ 

1/2 C milk

2 Tbs butter, melted

3/4 C baking mix

1 egg

Preheat oven to 350. 

In saucepan, melt butter with onion. Stir in veggies, chicken, and broth and heat to boiling. Add milk and cornstarch to mixture, remove from heat. 

Pour into a 2qt casserole dish.

In medium bowl, stir together topping ingredients. Drop onto casserole, I like to use an ice cream scoop to measure. 

Bake 25-35 minutes, until biscuits on top start to brown.
