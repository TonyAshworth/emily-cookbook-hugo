Chicken Zucchini Casserole

* 1-2 lb chicken breasts, cooked and cubed or shredded
* 1 box of your fave chicken flavored stuffing (we use Aldi’s livegfree brand)
* ½ C butter, melted
* 3 C cubed zucchini
* 1 can cream of chicken soup (for gluten free we use great value, or make from scratch)
* ½ C chopped onion
* ½ C sour cream

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Combine stuffing and butter, and set aside.

Mix chicken, zucchini, onion, soup, and sour cream in a large bowl. Add stuffing and stir well. Pour into greased 9x13 baking dish (I prefer a glass one here), and bake for 45 minutes.
