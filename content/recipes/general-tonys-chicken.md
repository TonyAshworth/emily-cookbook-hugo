* 3 Tbs cornstarch
* 1 egg
* 1-2 lb chicken, cubed
* 1/4 C sugar
* 1/4 C soy sauce
* 1/4 C vinegar
* 1 tsp minced garlic
* 1/2 tsp ginger
* 2 Tbs cornstarch mixed into 1/4C water
* oil for frying

Combine cornstarch, egg and chicken in a medium bowl and mix well. 

Heat oil in large skillet or wok, and once the oil is hot fry the chicken in batches until chicken starts to turn tan and look crispy (for us, this takes 4 batches). Place chicken on paper towel lined cookie sheet to cool. We like to use peanut oil for frying, but use what you prefer. 

After last batch of chicken. allow oil to cool slightly. While oil is cooling, make sauce: combine sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and ginger in a medium sized bowl. Set aside. 

Remove all but 1 Tbs of oil out of wok or pan. I do this with gloves and a funnel into an empty milk jug, in the sink. 

Pour sauce into skillet or wok, and heat. Add cornstarch slurry, simmer. Return chicken to pan, and stir, sauce should be just starting to thicken. Remove from heat and serve! This is excellent over rice!
