* 1 ¼ C sugar
* 1 C butter flavored shortening (crisco)
* 3 C flour
* ¾ tsp baking powder
* 2 eggs
* ¼ C light corn syrup
* 1 Tbs vanilla
* ½ tsp baking soda

Preheat oven to 375

Cream sugar and shortening in mixer. Add eggs, then syrup, then vanilla and blend well

With mixer off, add flour, baking powder and soda, then stir well

Divide dough into quarters and refrigerate for at least an hour. Dough should be firm.

Working with one quarter at a time, roll out dough (cover rolling pin and counter with flour) to maybe ⅜ inch thickness or so. Use cookie cutters, place shapes on cookie sheets. *To make cookies with a “wall” around edges, or straight sides, put cookies and cookie sheets in fridge for at least 15 minutes before baking*

Add colored sugar if desired, and bake for 5-9 minutes, just until the edges ever so slightly brown. Cool on sheet for 5 minutes then move to racks to cool completely
