Chicken breasts, cut into strips or bite sized pieces

1lb sliced bacon, cut into halves or thirds

2/3 C brown sugar

2 Tbs chili powder

toothpicks

Preheat oven to 350 (also yummy grilled). Stir together sugar and chili powder in a low bowl. 

Wrap each chicken piece with a piece of bacon, and secure with a toothpick. Dredge through sugar mixture, and place on either a foil lined pan or a sheet with a rack. Bake for 35 minutes or so, until bacon looks well done. Try not to eat it all in one sitting!
