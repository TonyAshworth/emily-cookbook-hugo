* 3 C broccoli florets, steamed and chopped (frozen is fine here, microwave it an you are ready!)
* 1 C shredded cheddar cheese
* 2/3 C milk
* 1/4 C half and half
* 5 large eggs
* optional, a sprinkle of nutmeg into the egg mixture makes this taste amazing!

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 

In a greased pie dish, spread broccoli on the bottom, then cover with cheese. Set aside.

In a medium bowl, whisk milk, half and half, and eggs. Pour over the cheese layer in the pie dish. Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until the center is set and doesn't jiggle when moved back and forth.
