* 3 C coleslaw mix (or shredded cabbage - we loved this with purple cabbage)
* 1/2 red pepper, sliced thin
* chicken boobs cooked and shredded
* 3 Tbs peanuts, crushed (I just bash em in double ziploc bags, with a book)
* 3 Tbs chopped cilantro (I don't add this, its soap)
* cucumber, thinly sliced (english cucumber is excellent in this)

For dressing:

* 4 Tbs smooth peanut butter
* 2 Tbs honey
* 2 Tbs warm water
* 1 1/2 Tbs soy sauce
* 1 Tbs rice/white vinegar
* 1 tsp sesame seeds
* 1 tsp sesame oil
* 1/4 tsp ginger
* 1 tsp minced garlic

\*if you like heat, add sriracha sauce to taste

Add ingredients for dressing into a large bowl and stir well. Add remaining ingredients and stir to coat. Store in fridge until ready to serve. YUM!

This is a great meal to make with precooked shredded chicken!
