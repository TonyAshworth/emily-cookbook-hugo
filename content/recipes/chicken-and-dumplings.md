* 2lb chicken (thighs, legs, quarters, you choose!)
* water
* bag of baby carrots, cut into slices
* 2 celery ribs, chopped
* half an onion (you can chop it or keep it big to pick it out if you don't like onions)
* 1 pkg frozen peas
* 1 1/2 C flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 3 Tbs butter
* 3/4 C milk

Place chicken in large pot, and cover with water. Boil over medium heat for 40 minutes. Remove chicken from broth and allow chicken to cool. Strain broth and return to pot. Pull chicken from bone, remove skin, tear or cut into bite sized pieces and return to broth. 

Add carrots, celery, onion, and peas, and return to a boil while preparing dumplings. You want the carrots to soften here. 

In a separate bowl, combine flour and baking powder. Add butter and mix into coarse crumbs (I do this with my hands). Add milk, mix well. Drop by small spoonfulls into pot. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes longer, until dumplings are tender when tested with a fork.
