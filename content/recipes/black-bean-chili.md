+++

1lb ground turkey or beef (to make vegetarian, use impossible meat or simply omit)

3 cans black beans, undrained

1 can diced tomatoes

1 Tbs basil

1 Tbs oregano

1 1/2 Tbs chili powder

1 Tbs red wine vinegar

1 onion diced, optional

In a large pot, brown meat and drain. Return meat to pot, and add all ingredients. Simmer for an hour or so covered, until the chili looks to be a good consistency. If chili stays runny, remove top and continue to simmer until it thickens.

If you like hotter chili, add peppers with the other ingredients, or add hot sauces to your bowl.
