* 1 C sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/2 C flour
* 1/4 C butter
* 4 ripe bananas
* 1 tsp baking soda

Preheat oven to 350.

Cream sugar and butter. Add eggs. Mash bananas and add to mixture. Stir in flour and baking soda. Bake in loaf pan for one hour, or until top browns and springs back when lightly pressed. Cook times vary on this one - just make sure it springs back in the middle when pressed lightly! It's ok if the top turns brown, it's supposed to!
