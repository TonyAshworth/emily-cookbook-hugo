Plain shredded chicken is excellent to keep in the fridge for salads, to toss with noodles in alfredo sauce, to make nachos with beans and cheese and chips, I almost always have shredded cooked chicken on hand. *always take the temp of chicken you cook this way, to make sure it has cooked through! I use large breasts generally, so I like to make darn sure they're done. I like to see mine come to 180 degrees. 

In a crockpot - place bs chicken boobs in crock pot, cook on low for 3 hours, shred. Store in fridge for up to 4 days.

Instant Pot method - Place 1c water into crock, and place chicken on rack/trivet. Seal. Cook for 10 minutes with quick release for chicken you can cut into pieces, or 15m with a 5m release time for chicken to shred.
