* bs chicken boobs
* potatoes, cubed (you can use any - out of sheer laziness I tend to buy a bag of those little baby sized ones and toss em in)
* baby carrots (I use my eye, sometimes I overload it with carrots sometimes I pour half a bag in)
* 2 Tbs butter
* 1 turkey gravy packet (we use gluten free McCormick packets)
* 3/4 C water
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp basil
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* i hate onions, so I toss in some dried minced onion. If you like onions, toss some in
* 1/4 C water with 2 Tbs cornstarch mixed in

Place meat and veggies in the crock. Mix spices and gravy and water together in a bowl, and pour over meat and veggies. Cook on low anywhere from 7-9hrs. Add cornstarch slurry, stir 'til thickened, and serve.
