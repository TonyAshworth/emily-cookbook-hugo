* 1 pie shell
* bag of frozen peas/carrots mix
* 1 Tbs dried minced onion
* 1 Tbs butter
* 1 Tbs cornstarch
* ½ C chicken broth
* 1 C cooked poultry, cubed or shredded
* 1 Tbs flour
* ¾ C milk

Preheat oven to 400. If using a frozen crust, thaw 10 minutes and remove paper.

In saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Add flour and cornstarch. Whisk in milk and seasonings. Stir until thickened. Stir in veggies and chicken.

Make instant mashed potatoes.

Place shell on baking sheet (to catch drips and make easier to handle). Pour filling into crust, then top with mashed potatoes. Bake for 40 minutes and enjoy!
