* 1 fillet per person, cod or haddock work well here
* ¾ tsp Tajin seasoning
* soft tortillas

Sauce: 

* ¼ C sour cream
* 3 Tbs miracle whip or mayo
* 1 Tbs lime juice
* ¾ tsp Tajin seasoning

Slaw: 

* ¼ C chopped cilantro, or a solid spoonful from the squeeze bottle
* 2 C shredded cabbage, a mix of purple and white is so festive!
* ¼ C shredded carrots 
* 1 Tbs olive oil
* 1 Tbs lime juice

Preheat oven to 400. Place fish in appropriately sized baking dish (we use a 9x13 for 5 fillets), and drizzle fish with olive oil, then sprinkle tajin onto fish. Bake until completely done, typically 25 minutes for us, but will depend on thickness of your fish.

Combine slaw ingredients, set aside.

Combine sauce ingredients, set aside.

When fish is done, break fish into chunks and heat tortillas (we flash heat them in a hot skillet) and assemble your tacos!
