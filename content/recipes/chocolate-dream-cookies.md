* 12 oz semi sweet choc chips
* 11.5 oz bittersweet choc chips
* 6 Tbs butter
* 3 eggs
* 1 C sugar
* ⅓ C flour
* ½ tsp baking powder

Melt bittersweet chips and butter in the microwave, careful not to burn chocolate.

In large bowl, beat eggs and sugar until thick, then add chocolate and butter mixture. Stir in semisweet chips. Using a sheet of plastic wrap, form dough into two logs around 2 inches in diameter. Wrap tightly and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.

Preheat oven to 375. Unwrap dough, and with sharp knife cut into ¾ inch slices. Place slices on parchment paper lined cookie sheet and bake for 12-14 minutes, until a shiny crust forms on the top but interior is still soft. Cool on baking sheet.
