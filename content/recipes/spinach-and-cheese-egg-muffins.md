* 6 to 8 strips of bacon, chopped
* 1 1/2 C shredded cheddar cheese
* 2 to 3 C spinach
* 12 eggs

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Beat eggs, then add cheese and stir to combine. Set aside.

In a medium skillet, cook bacon until done, drain fat, and add spinach. Cook just until spinach is wilted. Stir bacon and spinach into egg mixture, and pour into greased muffin pan (I use a ladle). 

Bake for 15 minutes, and let cool for 5 minutes in pan before removing from the muffin pan. Typically makes 12 muffins.
