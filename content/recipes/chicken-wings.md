Here are a few ways to cook wings, all of them taste amazing and are crowd pleasers!

**Basic wings:** 

Mix oil and a bit of salt onto wings, and spread onto foil lined baking sheet. Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for one hour and enjoy! These can be sauced with so many types of sauce, here are a few examples: 

**Buffalo sauce:** 

* 2/3 C frank's red hot sauce
* 1/2 C butter
* 1 1/2 Tbs vinegar
* 1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (optional)
* optional - 1/2 C honey to sweeten the heat

Stir all together in a saucepan, and just bring to a simmer, stirring regularly. Turn off and allow to cool. Add to wings. 

**White Garlic Sauce:**

* 1/2 C butter, melted
* 1/2 C grated parmesan cheese
* 1 tsp garlic powder, or 2 cloves minced
* optional salt and pepper to taste

Mix all, and add to wings. 

My favorite **Carmelized Wings:** 

* 1 C water
* 1/3 C soy sauce
* 1 Tbs honey
* 1 Tbs minced garlic
* 1/3 C sugar
* 2 Tbs peanut butter
* 2 tsp red wine vinegar
* chicken wings

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. 

Mix ingredients in casserole dish, and add wings and coat. Bake for 40 minutes covered, then 20 minutes uncovered. This sauce is amazing over rice! 

Another family favorite from The Omnivore's Cookbook, **3 Cup Wings**. These are a bit laborious but sooo worth it! 

* 2lb wings 
* 1/8 C olive oil
* 1/3 C chicken broth
* 3 Tbs brown sugar
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/8 C sesame or olive oil
* 1/2 tsp ginger
* 1/3 C soy sauce
* 1 bunch of fresh basil

In large skillet or wok, heat sesame and olive oil. On medium low, add chicken in single layer, cooking 5 to 7 minutes per side, to brown. We feed 5 to 7 people, so we have to do this in batches. 

Add broth to deglaze pan. Add garlic and ginger, then add soy sauce, sugar, and cooked chicken and stir to coat chicken. 

Bring to a boil and simmer covered for 40 minutes. Stir occasionally to coat wings. remove lid, sauce should have thickened. If watery, cook uncovered for a few minutes. Add basil and cook for two more minutes, then serve!
