* 6 large potatoes
* 1/2 C sour cream
* 6 Tbs butter
* 1 C shredded cheese
* cooked bacon

Preheat oven to 400 degrees, and pierce holes into the potatoes with a fork. I like to rub the skin with a bit of oil, so it crisps up a bit as it bakes. You can bake potatoes on a cookie sheet or directly on your oven racks. Bake until soft when pierced with a fork, maybe 45 minutes.  

Once baked potatoes have cooled enough to be handled, cut them in half and scoop the insides out, leaving enough to keep the skin sturdy. Set skins open side up onto a greased baking sheet. Turn oven on to 350 degrees. 

Mash insides in a bowl and mix in sour cream and butter. Scoop potato mixture back into skins. Top with cheese and bacon, and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, just to melt the cheese.
