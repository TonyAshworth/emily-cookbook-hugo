_sauce:_ 

2 Tbs honey

1/2 Tbs apple cider vinegar

2 Tbs dijon mustard

1/4 C olive oil

_meal:_ 

bs chicken boobs

1 C chicken broth (water in a pinch)

1/2 tsp garlic powder

1 Tbs olive oil

1 to 2lbs potatoes, cubed (I use a bag of tiny potatoes, like fingerlings, because they cook so well and become creamy explosions in your mouth)

Mix honey, mustard, and vinegar in a small bowl. Stir in oil, and separate 1/4 C of sauce for chicken and set rest aside.

Coat chicken with 1/4 C of sauce, and sear on "saute" setting in instant pot. Turn saute off. 

Pour in broth, and deglaze (scrape any stuck bits off the bottom). 

In a medium bowl, coat potatoes in olive oil, and sprinkle garlic powder over them. 

 Pour coated potatoes over chicken, seal the instant pot and cook on high for 7 minutes. Allow to release naturally for 10 minutes, then vent. Drizzle with remaining dressing and enjoy!
