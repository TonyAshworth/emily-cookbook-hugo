Mix together oyster sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, ginger, garlic, and sriracha into the instant pot. Add onion, then chicken. Close and seal, and cook on high for 10 minutes. Carefully quick release the steam, and use a fork to shred chicken. Add water chestnuts, and “saute” until sauce thickens slightly and chestnuts soften a bit. Serve with lettuce wraps, yum!
