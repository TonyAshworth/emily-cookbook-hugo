* 1/2 C butter
* 2 C flour
* 1/2 C milk
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 C sugar
* 2 large eggs
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 2 1/2 C blueberries
* 2 Tbs sugar (for tops)

Preheat oven to 375.

In a mixer, beat sugar and butter until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating after each egg. 

In second bowl, combine dry ingredients. Gradually add to mixer, while mixer is slowly stirring. Add milk and vanilla, stir well. 

\*Optional - mash 1/2 C berries and stir into batter by hand, making batter blueish and adding flavor to batter. 

Add remaining berries and fold by hand (mix gently with a spatula or spoon). 

Spray muffin tins or use paper liners, and full cups with batter. Sprinkle sugar on top, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes (until tops spring back when pressed lightly). Cool in pan, and then on rack and try not to eat them all right away!
