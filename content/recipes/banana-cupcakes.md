* 2/3 C mashed banana
* 3/4 C sugar
* 1/2 C butter, softened
* 3 eggs
* 3/4 C water
* 2 C flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda

Preheat oven to 350. Mix banana and butter until creamy (a potato masher works perfectly). Beat eggs in separate bowl, then add with water to mixture. Add flour, sugar, baking powder and soda. Mix well. Pour batter into lined muffin pans, filling cups 2/3 full. Bake at 350 for 15 to 20 minutes, until tops spring back and have just started to brown slightly. *Excellent with cream cheese frosting!
