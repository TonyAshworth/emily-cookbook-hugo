* 1 C fresh or frozen cranberries
* 2 Tbs sugar
* 2 Tbs water
* 1 ¼ C flour
* ¾ tsp baking soda
* ¼ tsp salt
* 2 Tbs butter, softened
* ½ C brown sugar
* 2 eggs
* 2-3 ripe bananas
* 1 ½ tsp vanilla
* ½ tsp sugar

In a small saucepan, combine cranberries, sugar and water. Simmer over medium heat until the berries “pop”, or crack, maybe 4 minutes.

Preheat oven to 350. Spray a loaf pan with nonstick spray.

In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt and set aside.

In a large bowl or in a mixer, cream butter and brown sugar. Add eggs, then bananas, then vanilla, mixing between each. Make sure to scrape sides of bowl. Add flour mixture, and don’t overmix!

Fold in cranberries, pour batter into prepared loaf pan and sprinkle a bit of white sugar over the top. Bake in center of oven for around 60 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean (don’t stick a cranberry lol). Cool in pan on rack.
