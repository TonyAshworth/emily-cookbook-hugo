__*this makes 8 or so dozen cookies*__

* 1 ½ C melted butter (3 sticks)
* 2 C sugar
* ½ C seedless raspberry jam, melted
* 2 eggs
* ½ tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 4 C packed flour

Melt butter then add sugar and mix, then stir in jam. Add eggs, one at a time, then add baking soda and salt. Mix in flour, one cup at a time. Refrigerate dough for at least 4 hours

Preheat oven to 350. Place ⅓ C sugar in a bowl, and roll dough into 1 inch balls and then roll in sugar. Place on parchment paper covered cookie sheet. Flatten with spatula and dent with a measuring spoon, or your thumb. Fill with a small bit of jam. Bake 10-12 minutes, cool 2 minutes then move to a cooling rack.
