bs chicken boobs

_dressing:_

1/3 C honey

3 Tbs whole grain mustard (or brown mustard if you want less seeds)

2 Tbs spicy brown mustard

2 Tbs olive oil

1 Tbs apple cider vinegar (white is fine, you are simply cutting the sweetness)

1 tsp minced garlic

_salad:_

a few slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled

4 or so cups romaine lettuce, or your fave lettuce, washed and ready to eat

1 C tomatoes (we substituted strawberries once and it was NEXT LEVEL yummy)

sliced avocado

1/4 C corn kernels (oddly enough, canned corn tastes really good in this)

1/4 of a red onion, sliced, optional

  
Set aside half of dressing in fridge, use remainder in skillet with chicken. Cook chicken through, and slice. This can be made right before tossing in the salad, or the day before and served cold. 

Place salad ingredients in a large bowl, add cooked chicken, and pour remainder of dressing onto salad and mix.
