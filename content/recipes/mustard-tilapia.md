* 1 fillet per person
* 1 ½ tsp spicy brown mustard
* 1 tsp worcestershire sauce
* 1 tsp lemon or lime juice
* ½ tsp garlic powder
* ¼ tsp oregano
* ¼ tsp basil
* Grated parm for topping

Preheat oven to 375. Place tilapia fillets in 8x8 or 9x13 baking dish, drizzle with oil and bake for 10 minutes.

Combine mustard, worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, garlic, oregano and basil and spread onto fish. Return fish to oven for 10 more minutes, or until fish is cooked through. Tops will be bubbly and golden! Great with parm sprinkled on top.
